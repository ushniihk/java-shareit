ShareIt. 
A project for sharing things. 
It provides users, firstly, the opportunity to tell what things they are willing to share, and secondly, to find the right thing and rent it for a while.
The service allows you to book things for certain dates, and closes access to it at the time of booking from other people. In case there is no necessary thing on the service, users have the opportunity to leave requests. On request, you can add new things for sharing.
